Use the included react scripts to start the frontend server. The frontend server will run on port 3000 by default. 
Run the backend at the same time and the applications should be able to communicate on your machine.

npm run build

npm run start
OR
npm deploy (runs production server)

npm run deploy-prod (push to heroku)
